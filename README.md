PS: Added more features after posting this video - Heads up!


## Project Build
This project uses Angular v6, Bootstrap CSS Framework v3 and Firebase Realtimedb for API connection test.

Project should work as it is. 
However, in case styling is creating problems, please Install Bootstrap via 
```
npm install --save bootstrap@3
```
Additionally, when using this project created with Angular CLI 6, you'll have an angular.json. In that file, you still need to add Bootstrap to the styles[]  array, the path should be 'node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'
